### LargeInsertionFeature

## Feature analyses of large insertion events

Insertions of mobile elements, mitochondrial DNA and fragments of nuclear chromosomes at DNA double-strand breaks sites (DSBs) threaten genome integrity and are common in cancer. Despite extensive efforts, our knowledge of these insertions still remains unknown. These tutorials will focus on the different features of large insertion events.

# Availability 

  1. Ty1 realignments, Ty1 insertion distribution
  2. Mitochondrial insertion distribution
  3. Mata insertion detection
  4. Inverted insertion detection
  5. ssDNA transformation
  6. Genomic preference: 

# Dependencies

Perl is used to run the scripts. The following softwares are also required:

. blast (ncbi-blast-2.8.1+)(https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download)

. pear (pear-0.9.11) (https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/pear/doc.html)

. bedtools (bedtools-2.25.0) (https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

# Install

```
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/gucascau/LargeInsertionFeature
```   

# Usage
```

```


# Output

For each insertion event, we selected the most reliable representative read that showed the highest read quality, highest donor identity and the highest read count support.
